#ABOUT CAMERA
A single-lens reflex camera differs from a twin-lens reflex camera in that in the case of the former, the same lens is used not only to view the frame, but also to capture images. This is possible thanks to a movable mirror set at an angle of 45 degrees to the optical axis of the lens. 

The pentagonal prism mounted above the mirror with several silver-plated surfaces makes it possible to observe in the camera viewfinder exactly the same image as that reproduced by the lens.
